<h1>Jets Project</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The objective of this week's project is to create an interface where users can retrieve and add data specifically related to the aeronautic industry. To accomplish this, we have created multiple Java classes, both public and abstract, along with their respective implementations. These implementations include the ability to create Fighter jets, Cargo jets, and Passenger jets. All of these classes are connected to a main abstract class with the basic capabilities of all airplanes. The user can see a dynamic menu where they can choose from a range of options for both input and output.</p>
<h2>Technologies</h2>

    <li>Stack Overflow</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>The main objective of this week was to implement a non-GUI app using Object-Oriented Programming capabilities and an introduction to Java libraries. During this process, we applied what we learned in the last two weeks of the cohort, including an introduction to new capabilities of OOP, such as abstract classes and implementation classes. We also learned new methods to create arrays using ArrayList, which is a more flexible way to manipulate data due to its ability to shrink and expand arrays.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges I faced this week was using the read from file feature. I forgot about it, and it took me over an hour to get the bufferin working properly. Another challenge was trying to get the elements from the list arrays. Through trial and error, I was able to fix it, but it took me longer than expected. Another challenge I faced this week was that I was trying to use "_" as a separator in the text file, and it was giving me an error. It took me around 45 minutes to figure out that the error was coming from the text file, as well as typing a floating point without realizing it, which caused the Java compiler to give me an error. Something that I need to start implementing is starting the project on Friday evening, so I can take advantage of the TA meetings on Saturday and save a lot of time trying to come up with solutions.</p>
