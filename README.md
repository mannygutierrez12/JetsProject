<h1>Jets Project</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The purpose of this week's project is to create an interface where the user can retrieve and add data specifically related to the aeronautic industry. To accomplish this, we have created multiple Java classes, both public and abstract, and their respective implementations. These implementations include the ability to create Fighter jets, Cargo jets, and Passenger jets. All of these classes are connected to a main abstract class with the basic capabilities of all airplanes. The user can see a dynamic menu where they can choose from a range of options for both input and output.</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Java Libraries</li>
    <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
    <li>Sublime Text</li>
    <li>GitHub</li>
    <li>Mac OS Terminal</li>
    <li>Google Chrome</li>
    <li>Google Search (Mainly to retrieve real data of actual airplanes)</li>
    <li>Stack Overflow</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>The main objective of this week was to implement a non-GUI app using Object-Oriented Programming capabilities and an introduction to Java libraries. During this process, we applied what we learned in the last two weeks of the cohort, including an introduction to new capabilities of OOP, such as abstract classes and implementation classes. We also learned new methods to create arrays using ArrayList, which is a more flexible way to manipulate data due to its ability to shrink and expand arrays.</p>
